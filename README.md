# Number-guessing-game-on-PYTHON
This is a small project creating a game.
<br>
The game is built with python code that we have to guess the number whichever computer has selected.
<br>
Whenever the user enters the number and if the number entered by the user is smaller than the target of the computer, than it gives hint that the number is small.
<br>
When the entered number is greater than target and viseversa.
<br>
The number entered is correct than the user is won.
